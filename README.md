Here’s my Basketball Website, built from "scratch" while learning through the Scrimba Fullstack Path! 🚀

My first project using Vanilla Javascript combined with HTML and CSS from previous lessons.

**Used:**
- Number(), Javascript Method to convert variables to numbers
- CSS Flexbox
- Figma to code

It’s live right here:https://gkbasketballscoreboard.netlify.app/ 🎉
